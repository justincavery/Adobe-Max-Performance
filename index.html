              <p>Zac Posen launched his eponymous collection in 2001, with a vision for modern American glamour that married couture technique with striking innovation. Envisioned in his New York atelier, Zac introduced a collection that combined legendary Hollywood glamour with a downtown sensibility, enhancing women’s natural forms and enabling them to be their most alluring, empowered selves.</p> <p>Raised in New York, Zac began his design training early. At 16, he attended Parson’s School of Design followed by London’s Central Saint Martins University. His collection launch quickly gained following by press, consumers and retailers alike as he carved his signature style. Two years following his first collection, he was awarded one of fashion’s most prestigious honors, Swarovski’s The Perry Ellis Award for Womenswear by the CFDA. Quickly, he was solidifying his position as a preeminent American designer.</p> <p>Today, Zac is known globally for his technique in artisanal craftsmanship, anatomical construction and textile manipulation. His daywear, suiting and red carpet eveningwear are infused with his bold sophistication, sexy femininity and distinctive glamour. Worn by leading women, including Uma Thurman, First Lady Michelle Obama, Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Watts, he has become a staple on the red carpet.</p> <p>His collections have grown to include Zac Posen, ZAC Zac Posen and Z Spoke Zac Posen with offerings in handbags, accessories, eyewear and fur. The collections are found in leading department and specialty stores worldwide including Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney’s New York, Harvey Nichols, and Seibu. In October 2013, Zac entered the bridal space with the launch of Truly Zac Posen in partnership with David’s Bridal, arriving in store in February 2014.</p> <p>Most recently, Zac has served as judge with Heidi Klum and Nina Garcia on Lifetime’s mainstay Project Runway, in its twelfth season.

                      Ethan Marcotte is an independent designer and author, who coined the term “responsive web design” to describe a new way of designing for the ever-changing Web. Responsive Web Design and Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles, his popular books on the topic, have been widely praised, showing how designers and organizations can leverage the Web’s flexibility to design across mobile, tablet, and desktop—and whatever might come next.

Over the years his clientele has included New York Magazine, the Sundance Film Festival, The Boston Globe, People Magazine, and the W3C. Ethan has also been a featured speaker at many conferences, including Webstock, An Event Apart, and SXSW Interactive.
