            <p>More and more companies are embracing design thinking but this often feels more like madness than a method for designing, prototyping and testing. During this interactive workshop Stephen Gates, Global Head of Design at Citi, and designer leader Geoff Dowd will walk you through how they create concepts, design, and prototypes for ideas in any medium using Design Thinking learned from leading global design studios and insights they have gained from working with Apple, Google, Adobe, and IDEO. </p><p>This session will provide tangible takeaways to help you: </p><ul><li>Implement design thinking processes and tools to drive innovation in your company</li><li>Understand the role of people in successful design thinking</li><li>Transition through the phases of inspiration, ideation, and implementation</li><li>Use tools like visualization, mapping, and storytelling to create solutions</li></ul>

            <p><em>On Rejection</em> is a funny and heartbreaking tale of making it (or not) in New York. The presentation begins in early 2003 when a good friend sent Debbie Millman an email with a subject line that read: Begin drinking heavily before opening. The email contained a link that took her to a "blog," the first-ever online forum about graphic design and branding. Suddenly she found herself reading an article that disparaged her entire career. This experience -; in tandem with a number of historical rejections and setbacks -; sent Debbie into deep despair, and she seriously considered leaving the design profession altogether. In a series of poignant, revealing, and sometimes hysterical anecdotes, Debbie will share her journey out of heartbreak and offer insight on how the worst moments in your life can actually become the most profound and life affirming.</p>

            <p>Sometimes ideas fly up like fireworks across the night sky. Other times the spark dwindles, dissipates, and dies. Why is it that the creative flow is such a fickle and finicky force? Why can't we conjure up creativity on command? Why do we need to keep coming back to conferences to be revitalized and revived? Perhaps there is a better way. This session is about igniting and sustaining the creative spark so that you can thrive. Professional photographer, author, and instructor Chris Orwig and Adobe Digital Imaging Evangelist Julieanne Kost will explore how to more effectively ignite and sustain creative growth. Rather than as a one-time experience, learn how to become creative again and again. Join them for an illuminating and refreshing conversation about how to reignite the creative spark, cultivate essential creative habits, and become a creativity machine so that you can do better work and lead a more meaningful life. </p><p>Chris and Julieanne will cover topics including: </p><ul><li>How to overcome resistance and fear</li><li>Developing creative habits</li><li>Becoming unstuck</li><li>Cultivating creative courage and confidence</li><li>Techniques for increasing the creative flow</li></ul>

            <p>Get involved in the workflow! Learn to take more control over your web designs by learning a few core concepts in HTML and CSS. With a handful of HTML tags and some basic CSS properties, you'll be able to share styles with web designers and developers and ensure the integrity of your design's translation to the browser. What's more, you'll learn to gather CSS properties directly from Photoshop and Creative Cloud and apply them to your own CSS file.</p><p>Chris Converse, designer and developer at Codify Design Studio, will share:</p><ul><li>What HTML and CSS are</li><li>Combining graphics and HTML using CSS</li><li>Gathering CSS properties from Photoshop</li><li>Sharing Photoshop files with developers on the Creative Cloud website</li><li>The role that JavaScript plays in HTML and CSS</li></ul>

With this change, designers struggle to express interactivity and flow with static screens and mock-ups.

  </div>
  <div class="text-left">
    <p>Expand your creative repertoire by learning how to shoot photos and using them to build composite images that can be used in a variety of design projects. Join internationally recognized Sony Artisan photographer, artist, author and educator Katrin Eismann and Adobe Certified Expert and composting and design instructor veteran Jason Hoppe as they guide you in this action-packed preconference session. You'll start by learning how lighting, posing and framing subjects can make the difference between good and great photography before hitting the streets of San Diego in a photo walk to shoot photographs of an assortment of characters in different settings. Back in a lab, you'll use compositing tricks in Photoshop to combine your photos with other photos and add effects to create images. Finally, you'll add stylized text to complete a poster that will be printed and displayed and yours to keep at the end of MAX. No previous photography experience is necessary. You will need a camera (phones are fine). Photoshop understanding is highly recommended. </p>

    <p><em>On Rejection</em> is a funny and heartbreaking tale of making it (or not) in New York. The presentation begins in early 2003 when a good friend sent Debbie Millman an email with a subject line that read: Begin drinking heavily before opening. The email contained a link that took her to a "blog," the first-ever online forum about graphic design and branding. Suddenly she found herself reading an article that disparaged her entire career. This experience -; in tandem with a number of historical rejections and setbacks -; sent Debbie into deep despair, and she seriously considered leaving the design profession altogether. In a series of poignant, revealing, and sometimes hysterical anecdotes, Debbie will share her journey out of heartbreak and offer insight on how the worst moments in your life can actually become the most profound and life affirming.</p>
