                  <p>Janet Echelman is an artist who defies categorization. Her work intersects across the boundaries of Sculpture, Architecture, Urban Design and Planning, Material Science, Structural and Aeronautical Engineering, and Computer Science. She creates experiential sculpture at the scale of buildings that transform with wind and light. The art shifts from being an object to look at, to a living environment you can get lost in. ​Using unlikely materials from fishnet to atomized water particles, ​Echelman combines ancient craft with computational design software to create art​works that ​have ​become focal points for urban life on four continents.</p> <p>Recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship, Harvard Loeb Fellowship, Aspen Institute Henry Crown Fellowship, and Fulbright Lectureship, Echelman was named an Architectural Digest Innovator for "changing the very essence of urban spaces." Her TED talk "Taking Imagination Seriously" has been translated into 34 languages with more than one million views. Oprah ranked Echelman’s work #1 on her List of 50 Things That Make You Say Wow!, and she recently received the Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in Visual Arts, honoring “the greatest innovators in America today.”</p> <p>Echelman’s educational path has been nonlinear. After graduating from Harvard College, she lived in a Balinese village for 5 years, then completed separate graduate programs in Painting and in Psychology. This year she received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Tufts University.</p> <p>Recent permanent commissions works include: 1.8 Renwick at the Smithsonian American Art Museum; Impatient Optimist, a new ionic piece for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation campus in Seattle giving visual from to their mission; Water Sky Garden, a legacy project of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics; Her Secret is Patience for downtown Phoenix; and Every Beating Second for San Francisco International Airport. Many Bostonians saw last year’s 600-ft installation over the Rose Kennedy Greenway which reconnected downtown Boston with its waterfront.</p>

                  <p>With his vibrant imagination and dedication to richly layered storytelling, QUENTIN TARANTINO (Writer/Director) has established himself as one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his generation.</p> <p>In 2016, Tarantino was awarded an AFI Honorary Degree for his heroic effort to shine a proper light on 70mm and the beauty of the big screen experience.</p> <p>In October of 2014, Tarantino became owner & programmer of the New Beverly Cinema, Los Angeles’ longest tasting repertory theater.

            <p class="text-left">
              <p>Janet Echelman is an artist who defies categorization. Her work intersects across the boundaries of Sculpture, Architecture, Urban Design and Planning, Material Science, Structural and Aeronautical Engineering, and Computer Science. She creates experiential sculpture at the scale of buildings that transform with wind and light. The art shifts from being an object to look at, to a living environment you can get lost in. ​Using unlikely materials from fishnet to atomized water particles, ​Echelman combines ancient craft with computational design software to create art​works that ​have ​become focal points for urban life on four continents.</p> <p>Recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship, Harvard Loeb Fellowship, Aspen Institute Henry Crown Fellowship, and Fulbright Lectureship, Echelman was named an Architectural Digest Innovator for "changing the very essence of urban spaces." Her TED talk "Taking Imagination Seriously" has been translated into 34 languages with more than one million views. Oprah ranked Echelman’s work #1 on her List of 50 Things That Make You Say Wow!, and she recently received the Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in Visual Arts, honoring “the greatest innovators in America today.”</p> <p>Echelman’s educational path has been nonlinear. After graduating from Harvard College, she lived in a Balinese village for 5 years, then completed separate graduate programs in Painting and in Psychology. This year she received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Tufts University.</p> <p>Recent permanent commissions works include: 1.8 Renwick at the Smithsonian American Art Museum; Impatient Optimist, a new ionic piece for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation campus in Seattle giving visual from to their mission; Water Sky Garden, a legacy project of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics; Her Secret is Patience for downtown Phoenix; and Every Beating Second for San Francisco International Airport. Many Bostonians saw last year’s 600-ft installation over the Rose Kennedy Greenway which reconnected downtown Boston with its waterfront.</p>

                Geoff Dowd is a designer, product developer and creative leader, dedicated to helping teams turn &quot;What if?&quot; ideas into 1.0 hits.

He lives at the design intersection of hardware, software and services, believing that the holistic design effort is the toughest, but also the most rewarding. Knowing that the first step is prototyping – prototyping your idea in any way possible – Dowd has spoken and led workshops to hundreds of creative professionals and students, giving them tools to make their ideas happen.

Most recently, Dowd served as Head of UX with Project Aura – a Google &quot;bet&quot;. His work there is secret for now.

Before his time with Google, Dowd served as Director, Experience Design with Adobe. It is here that he oversaw the creation of Adobe's Design and Drawing products – from nimble mobile apps that enable digital sampling of colors, shapes and brushes, to recharging Adobe's flagship desktop products for the next generation of designers – including the new design and prototyping app, Adobe Experience Design CC.

It is with Adobe that Dowd first discovered his love for hardware design as he led the conception, development, and launch of Adobe's first-ever consumer electronic hardware product, Adobe Ink & Slide – real tools for drawing on the iPad.

                Appropriately dubbed an “illustr-animator,” Syd Weiler of Sarasota, Florida finds inspiration in everyday life and the seemingly mundane. She works completely digitally, preferring her Microsoft Surface over a blank sheet of paper. While Syd learned most of what she knows in college and through her experience as a designer for forthcoming indie video game Jenny LeClue, she’s steadily grown a passionate online community that’s enthused about her continued work on “Before & After,” a series of digital illustrations depicting places in two different states of being side by side in order to explore the concept of time.

                With a background in multimedia and 3D design, Craig Winslow of Portland, Oregon spent the past few years building his own studio and creating interactive work for clients. His Kickstarter project, Projecting West, inspired his latest idea of recreating ghost signs across the U.S. using “Light Capsules” and historical references. The goal of the project is to draw attention to the lettering artists of the past and create various ways for people to interact with these pieces of history, in person and online. Craig’s work has been featured in The Creators Project, Core77, Gizmodo, and more.

As co-founder of the Brooklyn-based experience design studio WORKSHOP  she produces projects with love for clients like Etsy, Cultivated Wit, and TED. Jessi is an integral part of the team behind the super successful Brooklyn Beta, a web conference aimed at the “work hard and be nice to people” crowd, and Brooklyn Derby  the largest Kentucky Derby party outside of Kentucky.

Jessi’s belief is that people should consciously design their lives and careers to exploit their unique creative traits – not only accepting, but celebrating, what makes each of us different, weird and special.

                Sandee Cohen spent 20 years writing TV, radio, and print advertising for clients including Panasonic, Mattel, American Express, ABC News, Unilever, P&G (Procter and Gamble), and Pfizer Inc. In 1989 she left advertising to teach art directors and designers how to use “the machine” as Macintosh computers were known. 
In 1999 she was approached by Adobe Systems to beta test K-2, which was released as Adobe InDesign. From there she wrote the first InDesign Visual Quickstart Guide, which has solds hundreds of thousands of copies all over the world. She is the only non-Adobe employee to have written on all versions of InDesign.
She has taught for numerous private computer graphics schools as well as Parson’s School of Design, New School University, and Cooper Union. He private clients include Ralph Lauren, Tiffany & Co., HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Random House, Simon & Schuster, and Hearst Corporation.
In addition to authoring the InDesign VQS, she has recently written Creating Animations  with Adobe InDesign CC, and is the co-author, with Diane Burns, of Digital Publishing with InDesign CC. She has also written books and articles on Acrobat, Illustrator, FreeHand, PageMaker, and QuarkXPress.
2016 will be her third time speaking at Adobe MAX. However, she was a speaker when MAX was still part of Macromedia. She is thrilled to see the advancements in interactivity and animations for InDesign.

                Daniel Pelavin grew up in Detroit Michigan and began his career in local art studios. From his earliest work, produced with templates, french curves and drafting tools, to a present day virtuosity in digital media, Pelavin has used a restrained and simplified vocabulary of geometric forms, rich, flat colors and typography inspired by a wide range of 20th century ephemera. 

His mastery at combining stylistic elements from various historical periods while maintaining an unwavering focus on clarity has resulted in a body of work that is timeless and enduring. He has received recognition for illustration, typographic design and a singular ability to seamlessly combine the two. He began his journey into digital media at its onset and continues to play a pioneering role. 

Pelavin earned his BA in advertising and MFA in graphic design, but credits high school industrial arts classes and studio apprenticeship as his most valuable source of training and inspiration.

                A decade ago graphic designer and rock drummer Yves Peters started reviewing type in his Bald Condensed column on Typographer.org. In August 2008 he put his graphic design career on the back burner, freeing him to concentrate on his writing and related activities in the digital type business.

After writing for Unzipped, his blog on the FontShop BeNeLux home page, Yves came to notoriety as the editor-in-chief for the international design and typography blog The FontFeed. He is now design writer and producer for FontShop News, news editor for Typographics magazine, and assists MyFonts and a number of independent foundries as copywriter and consultant.

Yves tries to be critical about typography without coming across as a snob. His talent for being able to identify most typefaces on sight is utterly useless in daily life.

Nicole A. Phillips from Typograph.Her said of Yves: ‘One of the best contemporary writers on typography, type design & culture because he makes his content accessible and easy to understand.’

                Debi Sementelli is a professional lettering artist and font designer based in Dallas, Texas. She's had a romance with letters for the past 25 years. Her favorite moments are spent amongst pens, inks, paints, and brushes, wildly flourishing her way through an alphabet. In 2011 she moved from lettering artist to font designer basing all of her fonts on her own unique hand written lettering styles. She loves coming up with swashes, flourishes and ornaments to give designers a variety of choices to play with. She's been fortunate to watch her fonts make the Hot New Fonts, Rising Stars and Best Sellers list.  But her greatest thrill is seeing someone use one of her typefaces in a uniquely creative way.  That feeling of collaboration is what inspires her to keep creating more hand lettered fonts.  The next best thing is sharing her love of lettering with others.

                Dan Stiles has been working in the graphic design industry for more than 20 years. Cutting his teeth making punk flyers with sharpies and paper stolen from Kinko's, he quickly adopted digital tools in the early 90's. These tools, coupled with screen printing, shaped not only his art but his creative process. From working with bands like Arctic Monkeys, Wilco, and Tom Petty, to fortune 500 corporations like Google, IBM, and Nike, Dan has discovered that in both life and design, one thing leads to another.

                In 2002, Nicholas van der Walle was working as a Graphic Designer for an aerospace company. Having just designed a show stand, Nick’s manager wanted the artwork “more blue”. This seemingly small change took many days and created the question that there must be a better way. This is how Astute Graphics was founded; Nick designed and commissioned the creation of a plug-in for Adobe Illustrator named “Phantasm CS” which delivered instant color changes.
 
Over the last 10 years Nick has ensured that Astute Graphics leads the way through designing innovative, imaginative tools for vector designers that significantly save time, boost creativity and achieve refined results.

Astute Graphics now has a repertoire of 14 plug-ins available to purchase via their website. Clients range from individual freelancers to global corporations including Adidas, Disney and Apple. Nick heavily invests time in finding out what graphic designers and illustrators want and need which enables a steady stream of releases and learning material each year.

                Born in Tokyo to parents who traveled the world, Sarah Silver spent her early years in love with dancing and photography, studying both from a young age. Shortly after finishing her Master’s Degree in Photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, she was chosen to shoot for Surface Magazine’s prestigious Avant Guardian issue. Using professional dancers as models, the fashion shoot marked the beginning of Sarah’s love for combining movement and photography.
An established fashion, beauty, and movement photographer and director, Sarah’s extensive list of clients include Vogue, V, W, Allure, Proenza Schouler, Pantene, L’Oreal, Nike, Pantone, Sephora, Revlon, DKNY, AG Jeans, and Target. Sarah has also worked with Tresemmé in an award-winning collaboration for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.
Equally comfortable in front of the camera, Sarah is often featured on screen, herself, on shows such as Make Me A Supermodel, America’s Next Top Model, Project Runway and LA Ink.
In addition to her visual work, Sarah is a featured speaker for Photo Expo in NYC, APA, and at universities including Parsons School of Design, The Pratt Institute, The Fashion Institute of Technology, and The School of Visual Arts.

                Scott Valentine is a modern digital experimenter with a background in physics. For nearly 20 years, he has been exploring the boundaries of image making and processing, and creating art by coloring outside the lines. He uses these principles while teaching, preferring to demonstrate possibilities and enabling deep understanding of tools as a way to unleash creativity. His book &quot;The Hidden Power of Blend Modes in Adobe Photoshop&quot; and the companion title on adjustment layers both show off this approach and have been embraced as ground-breaking works on the topics. Scott currently writes the monthly column &quot;Photoshop Proving Ground&quot; where he deconstructs tools and techniques in approachable, useful ways. Scott Valentine's favorite question is &quot;What if?&quot; Want to know more? scoxel.com

                Chris started life like most humans, covered in placenta and with minimal motor skills. It wasn’t long before he gained enough coordination to become the drummer for a number of Boston based bands. Upon standing fully erect Chris attended an art school and learned to draw. Then someone invented the internet and another person invented Adobe Animate CC. Riding on the coattails of these individuals, chris was able to carve a unique niche for himself using both tools. Chris is a featured streamer on Adobe’s Creative Channel on Twitch.

“Being an artist means having the ability to manipulate light. Being an animator allows me to manipulate time. If I can manipulate light and time, then maybe, I'm a god. But then my daughter reminds me that I just “color” things  – and she’s exactly right.”

Aaron is no stranger to the arts. He grew up surrounded by artists – his father works in advertising, his brother in animation, and his mother styles hair.   
Aaron began his career as a Graphic Designer in corporate advertising. A few years later, he transitioned into an Interaction Designer role at a small local studio. His passion and talent for typography and brand identity still shine through his design work.
Currently, Aaron is the Design Manager for Pivotal Labs in San Francisco, CA.

                Leslie Yang is a product and visual designer with a decade of designing for real people.

Leslie started her career in public policy, but over time discovered a passion for compelling people to take action through design and data. When Leslie discovered user experience design, it allowed her to combine her passions of improving people's lives with cross-team collaboration, data visualization, storytelling, qualitative research, end-to-end product design, and clear business goals. Leslie believes it takes all kinds to make change -- hers just happens to be in the forms of pixels, lines of code, and Post-It notes.

Leslie is currently a Product Designer at Pivotal Labs, collaborating with teams from startups to Fortune 50 companies to transform how they design and develop solutions that meet user need and product market fit. At night, she loves practicing calligraphy and renovating her house.

                Geoff Dowd is a designer, product developer and creative leader, dedicated to helping teams turn &quot;What if?&quot; ideas into 1.0 hits.

He lives at the design intersection of hardware, software and services, believing that the holistic design effort is the toughest, but also the most rewarding. Knowing that the first step is prototyping – prototyping your idea in any way possible – Dowd has spoken and led workshops to hundreds of creative professionals and students, giving them tools to make their ideas happen.

Most recently, Dowd served as Head of UX with Project Aura – a Google &quot;bet&quot;. His work there is secret for now.

Before his time with Google, Dowd served as Director, Experience Design with Adobe. It is here that he oversaw the creation of Adobe's Design and Drawing products – from nimble mobile apps that enable digital sampling of colors, shapes and brushes, to recharging Adobe's flagship desktop products for the next generation of designers – including the new design and prototyping app, Adobe Experience Design CC.

It is with Adobe that Dowd first discovered his love for hardware design as he led the conception, development, and launch of Adobe's first-ever consumer electronic hardware product, Adobe Ink & Slide – real tools for drawing on the iPad.

                Appropriately dubbed an “illustr-animator,” Syd Weiler of Sarasota, Florida finds inspiration in everyday life and the seemingly mundane. She works completely digitally, preferring her Microsoft Surface over a blank sheet of paper. While Syd learned most of what she knows in college and through her experience as a designer for forthcoming indie video game Jenny LeClue, she’s steadily grown a passionate online community that’s enthused about her continued work on “Before & After,” a series of digital illustrations depicting places in two different states of being side by side in order to explore the concept of time.

                With a background in multimedia and 3D design, Craig Winslow of Portland, Oregon spent the past few years building his own studio and creating interactive work for clients. His Kickstarter project, Projecting West, inspired his latest idea of recreating ghost signs across the U.S. using “Light Capsules” and historical references. The goal of the project is to draw attention to the lettering artists of the past and create various ways for people to interact with these pieces of history, in person and online. Craig’s work has been featured in The Creators Project, Core77, Gizmodo, and more.

From there she wrote the first InDesign Visual Quickstart Guide, which has solds hundreds of thousands of copies all over the world. She is the only non-Adobe employee to have written on all versions of InDesign.
She has taught for numerous private computer graphics schools as well as Parson’s School of Design, New School University, and Cooper Union. He private clients include Ralph Lauren, Tiffany & Co., HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Random House, Simon & Schuster, and Hearst Corporation.
In addition to authoring the InDesign VQS, she has recently written Creating Animations  with Adobe InDesign CC, and is the co-author, with Diane Burns, of Digital Publishing with InDesign CC. She has also written books and articles on Acrobat, Illustrator, FreeHand, PageMaker, and QuarkXPress.
2016 will be her third time speaking at Adobe MAX. However, she was a speaker when MAX was still part of Macromedia. She is thrilled to see the advancements in interactivity and animations for InDesign.

                Daniel Pelavin grew up in Detroit Michigan and began his career in local art studios. From his earliest work, produced with templates, french curves and drafting tools, to a present day virtuosity in digital media, Pelavin has used a restrained and simplified vocabulary of geometric forms, rich, flat colors and typography inspired by a wide range of 20th century ephemera. 

His mastery at combining stylistic elements from various historical periods while maintaining an unwavering focus on clarity has resulted in a body of work that is timeless and enduring. He has received recognition for illustration, typographic design and a singular ability to seamlessly combine the two. He began his journey into digital media at its onset and continues to play a pioneering role. 

Pelavin earned his BA in advertising and MFA in graphic design, but credits high school industrial arts classes and studio apprenticeship as his most valuable source of training and inspiration.

After writing for Unzipped, his blog on the FontShop BeNeLux home page, Yves came to notoriety as the editor-in-chief for the international design and typography blog The FontFeed. He is now design writer and producer for FontShop News, news editor for Typographics magazine, and assists MyFonts and a number of independent foundries as copywriter and consultant.

Yves tries to be critical about typography without coming across as a snob. His talent for being able to identify most typefaces on sight is utterly useless in daily life.

Nicole A. Phillips from Typograph.Her said of Yves: ‘One of the best contemporary writers on typography, type design & culture because he makes his content accessible and easy to understand.’

                Debi Sementelli is a professional lettering artist and font designer based in Dallas, Texas. She's had a romance with letters for the past 25 years. Her favorite moments are spent amongst pens, inks, paints, and brushes, wildly flourishing her way through an alphabet. In 2011 she moved from lettering artist to font designer basing all of her fonts on her own unique hand written lettering styles. She loves coming up with swashes, flourishes and ornaments to give designers a variety of choices to play with. She's been fortunate to watch her fonts make the Hot New Fonts, Rising Stars and Best Sellers list.  But her greatest thrill is seeing someone use one of her typefaces in a uniquely creative way.  That feeling of collaboration is what inspires her to keep creating more hand lettered fonts.  The next best thing is sharing her love of lettering with others.

                Dan Stiles has been working in the graphic design industry for more than 20 years. Cutting his teeth making punk flyers with sharpies and paper stolen from Kinko's, he quickly adopted digital tools in the early 90's. These tools, coupled with screen printing, shaped not only his art but his creative process. From working with bands like Arctic Monkeys, Wilco, and Tom Petty, to fortune 500 corporations like Google, IBM, and Nike, Dan has discovered that in both life and design, one thing leads to another.

                In 2002, Nicholas van der Walle was working as a Graphic Designer for an aerospace company. Having just designed a show stand, Nick’s manager wanted the artwork “more blue”. This seemingly small change took many days and created the question that there must be a better way. This is how Astute Graphics was founded; Nick designed and commissioned the creation of a plug-in for Adobe Illustrator named “Phantasm CS” which delivered instant color changes.
 
Over the last 10 years Nick has ensured that Astute Graphics leads the way through designing innovative, imaginative tools for vector designers that significantly save time, boost creativity and achieve refined results.

Astute Graphics now has a repertoire of 14 plug-ins available to purchase via their website. Clients range from individual freelancers to global corporations including Adidas, Disney and Apple. Nick heavily invests time in finding out what graphic designers and illustrators want and need which enables a steady stream of releases and learning material each year.

Shortly after finishing her Master’s Degree in Photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, she was chosen to shoot for Surface Magazine’s prestigious Avant Guardian issue.

                Scott Valentine is a modern digital experimenter with a background in physics. For nearly 20 years, he has been exploring the boundaries of image making and processing, and creating art by coloring outside the lines. He uses these principles while teaching, preferring to demonstrate possibilities and enabling deep understanding of tools as a way to unleash creativity. His book &quot;The Hidden Power of Blend Modes in Adobe Photoshop&quot; and the companion title on adjustment layers both show off this approach and have been embraced as ground-breaking works on the topics. Scott currently writes the monthly column &quot;Photoshop Proving Ground&quot; where he deconstructs tools and techniques in approachable, useful ways. Scott Valentine's favorite question is &quot;What if?&quot; Want to know more? scoxel.com

                Graduated in Industrial design, Rafael started working on his third semester as an intern at Globo TV where he learned a bit of everything. One year later he started on the artwork in the advertising business and never came back. After four years of experience on the Brazilian market traveled to New Zealand where he spent more three years developing his technical and artistic skills. He didn't come back for his Uni diploma yet...

Lover of art, is interested in many technical branches and believes that digital art is just another media extension. What really counts at the end of the day is communication. 

Award winning CGI artist, loves photography, illustration and editing, even more when those are tied together.

                Chris started life like most humans, covered in placenta and with minimal motor skills. It wasn’t long before he gained enough coordination to become the drummer for a number of Boston based bands. Upon standing fully erect Chris attended an art school and learned to draw. Then someone invented the internet and another person invented Adobe Animate CC. Riding on the coattails of these individuals, chris was able to carve a unique niche for himself using both tools. Chris is a featured streamer on Adobe’s Creative Channel on Twitch.

“Being an artist means having the ability to manipulate light. Being an animator allows me to manipulate time. If I can manipulate light and time, then maybe, I'm a god. But then my daughter reminds me that I just “color” things  – and she’s exactly right.”

                Leslie Yang is a product and visual designer with a decade of designing for real people.

Leslie started her career in public policy, but over time discovered a passion for compelling people to take action through design and data. When Leslie discovered user experience design, it allowed her to combine her passions of improving people's lives with cross-team collaboration, data visualization, storytelling, qualitative research, end-to-end product design, and clear business goals. Leslie believes it takes all kinds to make change -- hers just happens to be in the forms of pixels, lines of code, and Post-It notes.

Leslie is currently a Product Designer at Pivotal Labs, collaborating with teams from startups to Fortune 50 companies to transform how they design and develop solutions that meet user need and product market fit. At night, she loves practicing calligraphy and renovating her house.
