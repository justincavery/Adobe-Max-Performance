              <p>Lynsey began photographing professionally for the Buenos Aires Herald in Argentina in 1996 with no previous photographic training or studies. She eventually began freelancing for the AP in New York, before moving abroad to New Delhi, India to cover South Asia. In 2000, Addario first traveled to Afghanistan under Taliban rule to document life and oppression under the Taliban, and has since covered conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Darfur, and Congo. She photographs features and breaking news focused on humanitarian and human rights issues across the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa.</p> <p>In 2015, American Photo Magazine named Lynsey as one of five most influential photographers of the past 25 years, saying she changed the way we saw the world's conflicts.</p> <p>Lynsey’s recent bodies of work include an ongoing reportage on Syrian refugees for The New York Times, ISIS’ push into Iraq, the civil war in South Sudan, and African and Middle Eastern migrants arriving on Sicily's shores. Addario was the official photographer for the Nobel Peace Center's 10th peace prize exhibition, photographing 2014 winners Malala Yousefzai and Kailash Satyarthi for an exhibition at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, Norway.</p> <p>Lynsey has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the MacArthur Fellowship, or ‘Genius Grant’ 2009; Overseas Press Club's award for 'Best photographic reporting from abroad in magazines and books' for her series ‘Veiled Rebellion: Afghan Women’. She was part of the New York Times team to win the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, for her photographs in ‘Talibanistan’. In 2010 Lynsey was named one of 20 women on Oprah Winfrey's Power List, for her Power of Bearing Witness, and one of Glamour Magazine’s 20 women of the year in 2011. In 2014, Lynsey was included as one of eleven renowned women photographers in the National Geographic Women of Vision exhibition and photography book. Lynsey is married with one son.</p>

              <p>With his vibrant imagination and dedication to richly layered storytelling, QUENTIN TARANTINO (Writer/Director) has established himself as one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his generation.</p> <p>In 2016, Tarantino was awarded an AFI Honorary Degree for his heroic effort to shine a proper light on 70mm and the beauty of the big screen experience.</p> <p>In October of 2014, Tarantino became owner &amp; programmer of the New Beverly Cinema, Los Angeles’ longest tasting repertory theater.  In 2015 it was named “Best Indie Movie Theater” by the LA Weekly.</p> <p>In 2013, Tarantino won his second Oscar for Best Screenplay for DJANGO UNCHAINED, starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, and Walton Goggins.  DJANGO UNCHAINED was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards (with wins for Waltz and Tarantino for Best Screenplay), five BAFTAS, and five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.</p> <p>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, Tarantino’s World War II epic, was a critical and box office sensation, garnering numerous awards, including six BAFTA nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and eight Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Achievement in Directing.</p> <p>Prior to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, Tarantino thrilled audiences with DEATH PROOF, starring Kurt Russell and Zoë Bell.</p> <p>In Tarantino’s KILL BILL VOL. 1 and KILL BILL VOL. 2, Uma Thurman, as “The Bride”, enacted a “roaring rampage of revenge” on her former lover and boss, played by David Carradine.</p> <p>Tarantino wrote and directed JACKIE BROWN, a crime caper loosely based on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum Punch, starring Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton.</p> <p>Tarantino co-wrote, directed and starred in PULP FICTION, which won numerous critics’ awards, a Golden Globe and Academy Award® for Best Screenplay, and the Palme D’Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.</p> <p>Tarantino wrote, directed and starred in RESERVOIR DOGS, which made an auspicious debut at the Sundance Film Festival and marked the beginning of Tarantino’s career as a filmmaker.</p> <p>Following the success of RESERVOIR DOGS, the screenplays that Tarantino wrote during his tenure as a video store clerk became hot properties: Tony Scott directed Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in TRUE ROMANCE, and Robert Rodriguez directed George Clooney and Salma Hayek in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.</p> <p>Tarantino joined Rodriguez, Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell by directing, writing and executive producing a segment of the omnibus feature FOUR ROOMS. For television, Tarantino directed the season five finale of “CSI.” The episode, titled “Grave Danger” garnered Tarantino an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. Tarantino made his television directorial debut in 1995 with an episode of the long-running drama “ER.”</p> <p>Tarantino’s diverse work as a producer exemplifies both his commitment to first-time filmmakers and his support for his experienced peers and colleagues. Tarantino served as an executive producer on Eli Roth’s HOSTEL, and HOSTEL: PART II, Roger Avary’s KILLING ZOE, and Katrina Bronson’s DALTRY CALHOUN, and Robert Rodriguez’s FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.</p>

              <h3>Writer, Director</h3>
            </div>
            <p>With his vibrant imagination and dedication to richly layered storytelling, QUENTIN TARANTINO (Writer/Director) has established himself as one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his generation.</p> <p>In 2016, Tarantino was awarded an AFI Honorary Degree for his heroic effort to shine a proper light on 70mm and the beauty of the big screen experience.</p> <p>In October of 2014, Tarantino became owner &amp; programmer of the New Beverly Cinema, Los Angeles’ longest tasting repertory theater.  In 2015 it was named “Best Indie Movie Theater” by the LA Weekly.</p> <p>In 2013, Tarantino won his second Oscar for Best Screenplay for DJANGO UNCHAINED, starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, and Walton Goggins.  DJANGO UNCHAINED was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards (with wins for Waltz and Tarantino for Best Screenplay), five BAFTAS, and five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.</p> <p>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, Tarantino’s World War II epic, was a critical and box office sensation, garnering numerous awards, including six BAFTA nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and eight Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Achievement in Directing.</p> <p>Prior to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, Tarantino thrilled audiences with DEATH PROOF, starring Kurt Russell and Zoë Bell.</p> <p>In Tarantino’s KILL BILL VOL. 1 and KILL BILL VOL. 2, Uma Thurman, as “The Bride”, enacted a “roaring rampage of revenge” on her former lover and boss, played by David Carradine.</p> <p>Tarantino wrote and directed JACKIE BROWN, a crime caper loosely based on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum Punch, starring Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L.

For television, Tarantino directed the season five finale of “CSI.” The episode, titled “Grave Danger” garnered Tarantino an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. Tarantino made his television directorial debut in 1995 with an episode of the long-running drama “ER.”</p> <p>Tarantino’s diverse work as a producer exemplifies both his commitment to first-time filmmakers and his support for his experienced peers and colleagues. Tarantino served as an executive producer on Eli Roth’s HOSTEL, and HOSTEL: PART II, Roger Avary’s KILLING ZOE, and Katrina Bronson’s DALTRY CALHOUN, and Robert Rodriguez’s FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.</p>
