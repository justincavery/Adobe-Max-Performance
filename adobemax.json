A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX.

It’s important to work with a print shop that knows their stuff, and Mama’s Sauce is one that comes highly recommended.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30336 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\" alt=\"giphy-1\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mama’s Sauce is a boutique spot-color shop that specializes in custom printing on letterpress, screenprint and hot foil.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

It can be seriously rewarding to feel the weight and cut of the paper, smell the fresh ink and finally hold it in their hands. It’s important to work with a print shop that knows their stuff, and Mama’s Sauce is one that comes highly recommended.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30336 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\" alt=\"giphy-1\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mama’s Sauce is a boutique spot-color shop that specializes in custom printing on letterpress, screenprint and hot foil.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

A little bit of planning in advance, however, goes a long way to ensuring that you get the most value possible from your registration fee and the time you spend in sessions and walking the exhibition floor. Here are 10 tips to enhance your experience at Adobe MAX and other conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do your homework</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t wait until you’ve arrived to start figuring out your conference agenda. Preparation is the most important aspect of attending a conference or tradeshow. Research where the event is (San Diego has so much to be offer!), who will be speaking, which vendors will be there and if anyone in your network will be in attendance. Decide on which sessions you’ll attend in advance and make an effort to connect with relevant speakers and exhibitors on social media beforehand.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack accordingly</strong></p>\n<p>Little things like showing up with a wrinkled shirt or forgetting to bring your business cards can easily sour your conference experience. Before you pack, make a checklist with important items like nice walking shoes, your business cards, an umbrella, your phone charger, etc. so you won’t be scrambling to replace forgotten items after arrival. Missing the Quentin Tarantino keynote because you need to run out to get band-aids or contact solution is not a position you want to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>Before you hand over your registration fee, figure out what you’re hoping to get out of attending a particular conference – be as specific as possible. Whether it’s connecting with a certain speaker, learning new tips and techniques to help you in your work or expanding your LinkedIn connections, knowing what you want to accomplish will help you prioritize your time.</p>\n<p><strong>DURING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read the conference program</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of ignoring it, page through the program. Even if you’ve already thoroughly checked out the conference website, the program is likely to include helpful information — a map of the venue, info on discounts and giveaways from conference sponsors and suggestions for local attractions, for example — that may not be available online. Don’t forget to check out the daily MAX e-newsletter, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t take other work with you</strong></p>\n<p>Tempting as it is to bring projects in progress with you, you’ll get more out of Adobe Max if you focus 100% of your energy on the event. Worrying about what you have to do when you get back or even working during the conference will only distract you from potential networking opportunities and the great speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to connect with those in close proximity</strong></p>\n<p>When you settle in for a speaker, chances are someone is sitting on either side of you, so make an effort to introduce yourself before the presentation starts or during a break. You never know what opportunities could arise from a simple introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule some free time</strong></p>\n<p>Overscheduling is a great way to exhaust yourself – as anyone who has ever tried to see and do it all on a family vacation can attest. Block out time in your conference schedule each day where you can relax with a cup of coffee, network with some newfound friends or just put your feet up in your hotel room for a few minutes to recharge.</p>\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow up</strong></p>\n<p>Every person you had a memorable conversation with should receive a personalized follow-up email. This is especially crucial if you were at the conference to identify sales prospects or new business connections. Don’t forget to reach out via LinkedIn to anyone you’d like to make room for in your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Review your notes</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you took notes on the MAX sessions you attended and your overall thoughts, right? It’s now time to review them. Did you hear about a great new productivity tool that you’re dying to try out? Jot down the name of a speaker’s book you’d like to pick up? Get some tips for streamlining your own creative process? Go through your notes and pull out those action items you want to address now that you’re back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Take time to decompress after the conference and think about what you did successfully and what you might want to work on – better prep, more time for networking, remembering that contact solution, etc.– for the next conference.</p>\n","date":"2016-10-14 15:47:46 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director","title":"Two Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/two-things-every-designer-should-know-before-becoming-a-creative-director/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"max-blog-generic04-1800x1013\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/max-blog-generic04-1800x1013-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>Adobe is proud to welcome Workfront as 2016 MAX sponsor.

So when I was offered the position of Creative Director at <a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/\">Workfront</a>, I thought I was ready. I was confident that my experience as a designer had prepared me for the role I was about to step into.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of weeks on the job, I came to a gut-punch realization: I was not ready. I was SO not ready. Not because I didn’t know my craft—but because I mistakenly believed that the craft was all I needed.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking at Adobe MAX in November about some of the painful lessons I’ve learned over the last four years working as a Creative Director in a presentation called “7 Things Every Designer Should Know Before Becoming a Creative Director.”</p>\n<p>My aim is to give the presentation that I wish someone had given to me back then—when I was just beginning my work as a CD. The presentation will cover a handful of the problems that caught me off guard—the issues that I believe most newly promoted creatives are unprepared to solve.</p>\n<p>I’d like to give you sneak peek into a couple of those lessons here today.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Go of Your Old Job</strong></p>\n<p>The first mistake I made as a Creative Director was thinking that my job was to be the organization&#8217;s uberdesigner. I thought that, as the creative team’s leader, my role was to directly shape, if not outright produce, every aspect of my team’s output. It seems ridiculous to me now, but in those first few months as a CD, I honestly believed that I could—that I should—have my hands in every single deliverable that my team produced.</p>\n<p>I learned through trial and error that this doesn&#8217;t scale. If everything has to go through you, then your team—no matter how large—slows to the pace of one. I also discovered, in a blow to my graphic designer ego, that it torpedoes the quality of the work as well. If everything requires your “touch,” then your team—no matter how diverse, how skilled, how talented—chokes on the constraints of one person&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>As a CD, I had to let go of my old job—producing the work—and embrace my new job—designing, maintaining, and growing the machine that produces the work. The machine is what I call the people, the processes, and the culture that make up your team.</p>\n<p><strong>Hire People Who Scare You</strong></p>\n<p>The second mistake I made as a CD was not understanding that the key ingredient to that people + process + culture equation is, of course, people. I discovered that staffing a creative team is a lot like playing a game of Settlers of Catan.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played, you know that setting up your initial game pieces—deciding where on the board to place your first city and settlement—is by far the most important part of the game. Making good choices at this stage of the game almost guarantees an enjoyable, competitive game for you—no matter how poorly you play from then on. In contrast, making poor choices during set-up all but dooms you—no matter how brilliant your play is afterward.</p>\n<p>Hiring is that important to the success of your team—it’s extremely difficult for a manager to turn a mediocre team member into a great one. Scratch that. It’s not difficult, it’s impossible. You can’t will an employee into sustained, exceptional performance. They have to choose that for themselves—and finding someone who has already made that choice is tough, but not nearly as tough as somehow divining which applicants will make that choice sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to hire people that are already better than you. CDs complain that strong talent and experience is hard to find, but in my experience, that’s not the problem—the real roadblock is the CD’s own pride.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to hire someone who’s smarter, more talented, hungrier than you. I can tell you from experience—it’s terrifying! You fear that hiring someone like that will expose you. That they’ll make you look bad. Which is true, they will, IF you are still trying to be the uberdesigner. But, if you’ve embraced your new role as the leader of your team, then you’ll discover (like I did) that hiring exceptional talent won’t expose you, it will exalt you.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two of many lessons I learned during my conversion from designer to CD.

Wrike is a <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">2016 MAX</a> partner. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our 2016 MAX partners who help make the conference possible.</em></p>\n<p>At Wrike, we try to be a different than other work management software. We’ve always believed that creatives are the strongest drivers of culture and positivity within a company, and have tried to build our tool around creative collaboration since our very early days.</p>\n<p>We also believe that teamwork tools should be about building great teams as much as they are about producing great work. People have told me that they feel like close friends with their remote colleagues they’ve never met in person, just because they have such great interactions in Wrike. That’s the result of putting effort into building a tool that fosters spontaneous collaboration, friendly discussions, and risk-free ideation.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to be making our debut at <a href=\"https://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> this year. Since our launch in 2007, we’ve held the philosophy that the key to brand growth lies in eliminating the distractions that too often come between imagination and creation. In short, we believe the key to a successful brand lies in letting creatives be creative.</p>\n<p>It’s that philosophy that led us to launch our solution for creatives earlier this year. By integrating tools like image proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud integration, and project management with a powerful social collaboration tool, we empower creatives to make work that is beautiful and impactful with less stress and confusion.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to challenge what has been the status quo of creative work for almost 20 years, and designing a new way for the world to work requires plenty of imagination. It also takes great care to make sure we&#8217;re improving what&#8217;s broken without breaking what works for your team. It’s worth it, because email is a 40-year-old technology that is not optimized for the speed needed in today’s creative development cycles. Creatives need tools that allow organized conversations, clear approvals, and the mobility to share ideas wherever they strike.</p>\n<p>I founded Wrike 10 years ago with the goal of making teams insanely productive. If I had to revise that now, I’d say, &#8220;insanely productive and creative.&#8221; The two go hand-in-hand as far as I’m concerned, because creativity is a critical part of making sure you’re standing out from the crowd and innovating in your job &#8211; whatever it is.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to meet you at MAX. Please swing by the Wrike booth, say hello, and tell us why you love being a brilliant creative.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31031\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-31031 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1520x1013.jpeg 1520w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-1013x675.jpeg 1013w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/IMG_7256-507x338.jpeg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Filev, Founder and CEO of Wrike</p></div>\n","date":"2016-10-11 22:54:16 +0000","categories":["Adobe MAX Segment","Adobe MAX 2016","MAX Sponsors"],"month":"October, 2016"},{"id":"experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max","title":"Experience the National Poster Retrospecticus Gallery at Adobe MAX","url":"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/experience-the-national-poster-retrospecticus-gallery-at-adobe-max/","author":"Elissa Dunn Scott","summary":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/10/National-Poster-Retrospecticus-Crowd-Boston-e1476121370832.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"national-poster-retrospecticus-crowd-boston\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" /></div>We’re excited to be bringing the National Poster Retrospecticus gallery to the MAX Community Pavilion this year!

Prints will be done on metal, wood, plastic, paper or other materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30590\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"color-filter-wheel-7153\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-675x1013.jpg 675w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-450x675.jpg 450w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153-225x338.jpg 225w, https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/Color-Filter-Wheel-7153.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is your chance to untether yourself from your computers and dive back into the real word by using hand made objects, layering and other techniques to simulate what can be done on a machine for image making.

For many, few things are more exciting than unwrapping the package from the print shop to see their design finalized for the first time. It can be seriously rewarding to feel the weight and cut of the paper, smell the fresh ink and finally hold it in their hands. It’s important to work with a print shop that knows their stuff, and Mama’s Sauce is one that comes highly recommended.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30336 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/files/2016/09/giphy-1.gif\" alt=\"giphy-1\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mama’s Sauce is a boutique spot-color shop that specializes in custom printing on letterpress, screenprint and hot foil.
